# INTERNPROVE_CS_01
A step-by-step guide and a Python script for a simple image encryption tool using pixel manipulation. This tool will allow users to encrypt and decrypt images.

Step-by-step guide:

1. Set up the environment:
   - Install Python (if not already installed)
   - Install required libraries: Pillow (PIL)

2. Import necessary modules:
   - PIL for image processing
   - random for generating a random key

3. Define functions for encryption and decryption:
   - encrypt_image(): Applies a simple XOR operation to each pixel
   - decrypt_image(): Reverses the XOR operation to recover the original image

4. Implement key generation:
   - Create a function to generate a random key for encryption

5. Create the main program flow:
   - Allow users to choose between encryption and decryption
   - Prompt for input and output file paths
   - Apply the chosen operation and save the result

Now, let's create the Python script:

This script provides a simple image encryption tool using pixel manipulation. 

Here's how it works:

1. The `generate_key()` function creates a random 256-byte key for encryption.

2. The `encrypt_image()` function:
   - Opens the input image
   - Creates a new image for the encrypted result
   - Iterates through each pixel
   - Applies an XOR operation between each color channel and a byte from the key
   - Saves the encrypted image

3. The `decrypt_image()` function uses the same process as encryption, as XOR is its own inverse operation.

4. The `main()` function provides a simple command-line interface for users to choose between encryption and decryption, input file paths, and handle the key.

To use this tool:

1. Save the script as `image_encryption.py`
2. Run the script: `python image_encryption.py`
3. Follow the prompts to encrypt or decrypt images

Note: This is a basic implementation and not suitable for high-security applications. For real-world use, consider using established cryptographic libraries and more sophisticated encryption methods.
